weather challenge
WeatherPy.ipynb loads many cities and analyzes weather based on location. 

VacationPy.ipynb narrows the list from WeatherPy to ideal conditions and finds nearby hotels. 

Worked with study group individuals from class and found code from sources below. Also used ChatGPT to debug in WeatherPy when I got stuck.
